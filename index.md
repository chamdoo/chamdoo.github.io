I am an associate professor at EECS, DGIST (Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology). Before joining DGIST in July 2017, I worked as an assistant professor at Inha University from March 2016 to June 2017. I was a postdoctoral associate in the Computation Structures Group (CSG) at MIT CSAIL advised by Prof. Arvind. At MIT, I worked on the development of system software for high-performance storage systems, in particular, for non-volatile memory systems. I earned the PhD and MS degrees in computer science and engineering from the Seoul National University (SNU) in 2013 and 2007, respectively, and received the BE degree in electrical engineering from the Korea University in 2005. At SNU, I was a member of the Computer Architecture and Embedded System Laboratory (CARES) led by Prof. Jihong Kim. My current research interests include system software, storage systems, operating systems, and embedded software.
